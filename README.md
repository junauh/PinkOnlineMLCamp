# Pink Programming Online Machine Learning Summer Camp 2020

Machine Learning Camp 2020, organized by Pink Programming.

The camp took place between August 12 - August 16, 2020. The camp provided an introduction to Machine Learning, focusing on the basic concepts in supervised and unsupervised learning, through interactive lectures and hands-on project-based exercises.

The course included the following:
Learning how to use common machine learning tools like Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Introduction to classification, regression and clustering. 
A thorough theoretical walkthrough of the algorithms K-Nearest Neighbours, Linear Regression and K-Means.
Implementing K-Nearest Neighbours using Python.
Building a K-Nearest Neighbour model to classify Iris flowers and acceptability of cars.
Building a Linear Regression model to predict sales of social media advertisement and quality of red wine.
Building a K-Means model to identify customer segments and different types of wines.
Evaluating classification models using train/test split and the metric accuracy score.
Evaluating regression models using train/test split, cross-validation and the metrics MAE, MSE and RMSE.
Evaluating number of clusters for K-Means using Elbow method and Silhouette method.
Applying principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize multi-dimensional datasets in 2D and 3D and measuring the reductionâ€™s efficiency.
